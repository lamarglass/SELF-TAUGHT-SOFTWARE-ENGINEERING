I got an old laptop from my aunts's store, it runs a core i3 5005u processor, 4GB RAM, 254GB HDD storage, No Graphics card, and oviously a windows 8 pro. The Operating system consumed 2.6GB of RAM when idle and over 3GB of RAM when idle wih internet access, I had to install arch linux with minimal profile and hyprland minimal customisation to save resources, I was proud, but i really need to save up for better hardware before i really get my hands into advanced artificial intelligence studies.
