            [Verse 1]

             She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
             She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
             She had the sightless eyes, tellin' me no lies
             Knockin' me out with those American thighs
             Takin' more than her share, had me fightin' for air
             She told me to come, but I was already there
             'Cause the walls start shakin', the Earth was quakin'
             My mind was achin', and we were makin' it

            [Chorus]

             And you
             Shook me all night long
             Yeah, you
             Shook me all night long

            [Verse 2]

             Workin' double-time on the seduction line
             She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine, all mine
             Wanted no applause, just another course
             Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
             Had to cool me down to take another round
             Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
             That the walls were shakin', the Earth was quakin'
             My mind was achin', and we were makin' it

            [Chorus]

             And you
             Shook me all night long
             Yeah, you
             Shook me all night long
             It knocked me out that you
             Shook me all night long
             It had me shakin' and you
             Shook me all night long

            [Post-Chorus]

             Yeah, you shook me
             Well, you took me

            [Guitar Solo]

            [Chorus]

             You really took me and you
             Shook me all night long
             Ah, you
             Shook me all night long
             Yeah, yeah, you
             Shook me all night long
             You really got me and you
             Shook me all night long
             [Outro]
             Yeah, you shook me
             Yeah, you shook me
             All night long
