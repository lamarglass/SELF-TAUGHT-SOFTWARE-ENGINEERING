# 🧠 PROJECT-SELF-TAUGHT-SOFTWARE-ENGINEER

Welcome to my **Self-Taught Software Engineering & AI Engineering Journey** 🚀  
This repository documents my entire self-learning path — from foundational programming to advanced artificial intelligence and full-stack development.

## 📘 About the Project

This repo is my personal roadmap, code archive, and learning tracker as I transition into a **professional Software & AI Engineer** through self-teaching.  
It contains every concept, project, and experiment I complete along the way — a digital reflection of my growth.
